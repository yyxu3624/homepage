                              <b>摘要:</b> We study the two dimensional random field Ising model in a box with size N where the external field is given by i.i.d. normal variables with mean 0 and variance \eps^2 and derive the following phase transition of boundary influence 
                                (i.e., the difference between the spin averages at the center of the box with the plus and the minus boundary conditions) at critical temperature T_c=T_c(2): 
                                For \eps \ll N^{-7/8}, the boundary influence decays as N^{-1/8}; for \eps \gg N^{-7/8}, the boundary influence decays as N^{-1/8}e^{-\Theta(\eps^{8/7}N)}. 

                               We also study the two dimensional random filed FK-Ising model.  The total variation (TV) distance between the FK-Ising measures with and without external filed has the following phase transition:
                               The critical order for \eps is N^{-1}, N^{-15/16} and N^{-1/2} for T \gt T_c, T=T_c and 0\lt T \lt T_c respectively; in each case, above this critical order, the TV distance converges to 1 as N goes to infinity and to 0 below.

                              <b>题目:</b> Anticipated backward stochastic evolution equations and maximum
principle for path-dependent systems in infinite dimension <br>
                              <b>摘要:</b> For a class of path-dependent stochastic evolution equations driven by cylindrical $Q$-Wiener process, we study the Pontryagin's maximum principle for the stochastic recursive optimal control problem. In this infinite-dimensional control system, the state process depends on its   past trajectory, the control is delayed via an integral with respect to a general finite measure, and the final cost relies on the delayed state.
To obtain the maximum principle, we introduce a new type of non-anticipative path derivative and its dual operator, which allows us to derive an anticipated backward stochastic evolution equation as the adjoint equation of the state equation. This is joint work with Guomin Liu and Meng Wang.  <br>

                              <b>摘要:</b> The entropy producing phenomenon is fundamental in physics. It demonstrates the tendency of non-equilibrium states to equilibrium states as a system evolves. 
                                In the mathematical study of kinetic theory, it is one of the key goals to describe this phenomenon quantitatively and rigorously. 
                                The logarithmic Sobolev inequality and its nonlinear analogues have played an important role in this direction. 
                                In this talk, I will present results and questions about this functional inequality approach. 
                                I will start by introducing basic facts and some related questions/progresses about logarithmic Sobolev inequality. 
                                Then I will speak about its nonlinear analogues for the following models: the McKean-Vlasov equation, the Landau equation and the Kac model. <br>

                              <b>摘要:</b> Let $X^\beta$ be a real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrix whose entries are independent Gaussian random fields. 
                                We provide the sufficient and necessary conditions such that multiple collisions of eigenvalue processes of $A^\beta + T_\beta X^\beta T_\beta^*$ occur with positive probability. 
                                In addition, for a real or complex rectangular matrix $W^\beta$ with independent Gaussian random field entries, we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under which the probability of multiple collisions of non-trivial singular value processes of $B^\beta + T_\beta W^\beta \tilde T_\beta$ is positive. 
                                In both cases, the size of the set of collision times is characterized via Hausdorff dimension. <br>

                              <b>摘要:</b> Real systems are often subject to noises due to internal uncertainties and complexity as well as external randomness. 
                                Even small noises can lead to intriguing dynamics across multiple timescales including transient dynamics and long-term dynamics captured by quasi-stationary distributions and stationary distributions, respectively. 
                                Understanding the asymptotic behaviors of (quasi-)stationary distributions in the small noise limit is of fundamental importance. 
                                However, this analysis presents a singular limit, posing significant challenges. A powerful approach is to establish the large deviation principle (LDP) for (quasi-)stationary distributions. 
                                In this talk, we will present our recent results on the existence and regularity of the quasi-potential function in LDP, which have broad and impactful applications across various disciplines. 
                                Specifically, we will discuss its applications in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.   <br>

                              <b>摘要:</b> Inhomogeneous random matrices with a non-trivial variance profile determined by a symmetric Markov matrix and with independent symmetrically sub-Gaussian entries up to Hermitian symmetry, include many prominent examples, 
                            such as Wigner matrices, remarkable sparse Wigner matrices and random band matrices, and have been of great interest recently. 
                                In this talk, we study low-rank additive perturbations of such random matrices, and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at the level of law of large numbers. 
                                Under suitable conditions on the variance profile and the finite-rank perturbation, we also establish the fluctuations of spectral outliers that may be characterized by the general inhomogeneous random matrices. 
                                This reveals the strong non-universality phenomena, which may depend on eigenvectors, sparsity or geometric structure.

                              <b>题目:</b> Space-time joint laws of the KPZ fixed point <br>         
                              <b>摘要:</b>  The KPZ fixed point, first constructed by Matetski-Quastel-Remenik, is a universal scaling limit for the so-called Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, 
                                a large family of random growth models in 1+1 (space + time) dimension. It can be described as a Markov process on the space of height functions with explicit transition probabilities (fixed time spatial laws). 
                                In this talk I will introduce this object and discuss the integrability around it. In particular I will show some new formulas describing the space-time joint laws of this two-dimensional random fields and discuss some applications of the complicated formulas.
